# Challenge_14_Machine_Learning
This is a Jupyter Notebook that uses financial Python programming and machine learning to create an algorithmic trading bot that learns and adapts to new data and evolving markets. This notebook will Implement an algorithmic trading strategy that uses machine learning to automate the trade decisions, Adjust the input parameters to optimize the trading algorithm, and Train a new machine learning model and compare its performance to that of a baseline model.

## Technologies 

This project leverages python 3.7 with the following packages:

```
Jupyter Notebook 
NumPy
Pandas
hvPlot
matplotlib
scikit-learn
```

---

## Installation Guide 

Before running the application first install the following dependencies.

Install Anaconda Package
```
Pip intall Jupyter 
```

---

## Usage 

To create an algorithmic trading bot, clone the repository and run **Jupyter Lab** in python: 

```python
Jupyter Lab
```

Jupyter lab should launch in a web browser, if it doesnt select one one of the hyperlinks it provides copy it and paste it into a web browser page.

## Tune the Baseline Trading Algorithm

### Tune the training algorithm by adjusting the size of the training dataset. 

What impact resulted from increasing or decreasing the training window?
